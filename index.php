                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm a dedicated Computer Science and Engineering student at KUET with a passion for developing 
                    innovative solutions through technology. My journey began with curiosity about how applications work, 
                    which led me to explore mobile app development, web technologies, and software engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently in my third year, I've gained experience in various programming languages and frameworks, 
                    with a special focus on mobile app development using Flutter and Android native development. 
                    I enjoy tackling complex problems and turning ideas into reality through clean, efficient code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, you can find me participating in programming competitions, contributing to 
                    open-source projects, or exploring the latest trends in technology and software development.
